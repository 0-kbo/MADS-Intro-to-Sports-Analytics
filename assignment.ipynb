    "# Assignment\n",
    "In this course assignment you must build a predictive model to determine what place a runner will come in in a foot race. More specifically, you must predict the place order for all participants running races in the year 2019 which are part of a series (e.g. they have been run annually, or at least once previously) using historical data. **For each race you must predict the integer place ordering for all participants**. You are not predicting the top n finishers, or performance bands where people will finish. Instead, your method is expected to be integrated into a premium feature of an application such as Strava, where historical data and data about the racer (and who is signed up for the race!) could be used to help build a personalized prediction for them.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Framing\n",
    "Through this assignment you will demonstrate your ability to build sophisticated supervised machine learning models, from data manipulation through feature engineering and modelling. This is an authentic dataset, and a real-world problem. You can use whatever modelling method you would like to, and can characterise the problem as a regression, classification, or ordinal prediction problem. There is no particular guidelines you must follow, nor guidance offered in the course _per se_ however, there is plenty of opportunity to ask course staff questions. **It is expected that this assignment will take significant effort**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## About the Data\n",
    "All of the races you are asked to predict outcomes for have a temporal relationship with some race in the past (e.g. they are part of an annual series), and I have included an identifier `sequence_id` to help identify this. The `sequence_id` will be included in all races you need to predict, so you can build race-specific features should you wish to. Races which are in your training set and do not have a `sequence_id` could be used however you might like. There may be some races which have a `sequence_id` in the training set but do not have a `sequence_id` in the holdout set -- this all depends what is offered in a given year!\n",
    "\n",
    "A couple of core concepts are important beyond sequences. First, races have categories, which generally (though doesn't need to) denote the length of the race (e.g. 5k, marathon, etc). I've cleaned this column into a new one, prepending the word `clean` so that a columns such as `category.completed.name` becomes `clean_category.completed.name`. I have left the original data in there for you as well, and the transformations I've done have been largely to reduce dimensionality along lines I think is reasonable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to a category, there are `brackets`. Brackets typical denote demographic aspects of the runners and group them, such as Men aged 40-45. I have removed bracket information from the data and instead want you to focus on overall prediction which merges all runners in a given category together. This (should) line up with the rank order based on the individual's time, though I have not verified it (and predicting time is **not** the task).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation Criteria\n",
    "In this assignment you will be penalized equally for incorrect predictions weighted by the distance by which you are incorrect within a given race. It does not matter whether you over or under predicted a given rank, you are penalized one point per position you are off for a given individual. All DNF's are removed from the dataset, so each person in the dataset has a rank. You *must* provide a predicted rank for each person however, you may rank multiple people at the same spot if you would like (e.g. ties). The evaluation is for each combination of event and category, so a given event may have a 5 kilometer category, a 1 mile category, and so forth. Only individuals registered for a given event and category combination are included in the `DataFrame` you will be asked to predict for. Each event/category pair is equally weighted, and is scaled by the size of the event. Your overall prediction score will be the sum of all scores across the prediction tasks (e.g. across unique combinations of event and category). The exact scoring function is provided below."

    "## Example Solution\n",
    "The following cell contains an example solution to demonstrate the API which is used for this assignment. In short, you are to create an `sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline` object which you `fit()` on your training data using whatever method you like and serialize it to disk in a file called `pipeline.cloudpickle`. This object will then be reinstantiated in the autograder and evaluated based on the scoring function described above. Please note that the solution below would be a poor one, it is intended **only** to demonstrate the API for submission."

    "With a minimum pipeline built we can think about testing it. The code below simulates the autograder, and is something you can use to evaluate how your model performs. The most important function is the `score()` function, which demonstrates how the score of the model fitness will be determined, as described previously. This function just compares two ranked lists and determined how aligned they are with one another. The second function is the `evaluate()` function, which runs your model over a given race of data. Note that the evaluation generates new ranks from the `overall_ranking` but doesn't use those numbers directly. Those numbers are in-order, but due to underlying data assumptions may have gaps."
